pTFTPd is a pure-Python TFTP tool suite. It features a TFTP server and client
fully compliant to the TFTP specification defined in RFC1350. It also supports
the TFTP Option Extension protocol (per RFC2347), the block size option as
defined in RFC2348 and the transfer size option from RFC2349.

The pTFTPd tool suite also includes a mini-DHCP server, a BOOTP server, and a
complexe PXE solution based on the DHCP and TFTP servers.
