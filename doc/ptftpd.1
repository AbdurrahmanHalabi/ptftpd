supports TFTP extensions defined in RFC2347, RFC2348 and RFC2349, to the
exception of the timeout option only.
.PP
.B ptftpd
serves the given TFTP root directory to clients connecting to its listening
port (defaults to the standard TFTP port UDP 69). It supports reads (RRQ) and
writes (WRQ) in both netascii and octet mode and obviously complies to whatever
directory and file permissions in the given TFTP root.

also treats the TFTP root as a jail, and will make sure no operation is
attempted to access files outside the TFTP root directory.
