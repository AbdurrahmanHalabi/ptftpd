pTFTPd - Python TFTP utilities
------------------------------

pTFTPd is a collection of tools related to TFTP. It includes a TFTP server, a
TFTP client, and a complete PXE solution based on this TFTP server and a
micro-DHCP/BOOTP server. All these are written in Python and designed to be
fast, RFC compliant and easy to use.

The TFTP server, pTFTPd, fully supports the TFTP specification as defined in
RFC1350. It also supports the TFTP Option Extension protocol (per RFC2347), the
block size option as defined in RFC2348 and the transfer size option from
RFC2349.

For help on how to use pTFTPd, type:

  ./ptftpd.py --help

The port used can be changed using the -p option. The root path is given as a
simple argument. For example, to serve /var/lib/tftp on port 6969:

  ./ptftpd.py -p 6969 /var/lib/tftp

The TFTP client is an interactive client, just launch it and type 'help' to see
the available commands:

  ./tftp.py
  tftp> help
  ...

The PXE system is also very easy to use. It takes three arguments: the network
interface to listen on, the TFTP root path from which to serve files, and the
PXE boot filename. See --help for more details:

  ./pxed.py --help

All tools also understand the --rfc1350 option, which forces them in basic
RFC1350 compliance mode, disabling all TFTP extensions for increased
compatibility would you encouter any problem with your target system.
