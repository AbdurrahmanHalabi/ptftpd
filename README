pTFTPd - A Python TFTP server

pTFTPd is a simple TFTP daemon written in Python. It fully supports
the TFTP specification as defined in RFC1350. It also supports the TFTP
Option Extension protocol (per RFC2347), although the specific options
themselves are not yet supported (RFC2348 and RFC2349).

Usage:

For help on how to use pTFTPd, type:

	./ptftpd.py --help

By default, pTFTPd will listen on port 6969 and serve /tftpboot. Use
the -p and -b options to change this :

	./ptftpd.py -p 69 -b /var/lib/tftp/
